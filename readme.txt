1. Overview

Uploading HEX files: The application uses a USBasp programmer to upload firmware (in HEX format) directly to the ATmega328P microcontroller.
Serial Communication Monitoring: The application allows users to configure serial communication parameters and view data transmitted from the microcontroller.

2. Methodology
2.1. HEX File Uploading

USBasp Programmer Integration: The application interfaces with the USBasp programmer, which is a USB-based device used to program AVR microcontrollers like the ATmega328P.
File Selection: Users can select the HEX file they wish to upload to the microcontroller.
Programming Process: Upon selecting the HEX file and initiating the upload process, the application sends the HEX file to the microcontroller via the USBasp programmer. The upload process is handled correctly, ensuring that the microcontroller is programmed with the desired firmware.

2.2. Serial Communication Configuration
Baud Rate Selection: Users can choose the baud rate, which defines the speed of communication between the microcontroller and the application.
Port Selection: The application allows users to select the appropriate COM port to which the microcontroller is connected.
Parity Bit Configuration: Users can choose the parity bit setting, which helps in error detection during communication.
Stop Bits and Data Bits: These parameters can also be configured to match the communication settings of the microcontroller.

2.3. Data Monitoring
Real-time Data Viewing: Once the communication parameters are configured, users can click the "View" button to start receiving and displaying data from the microcontroller in real-time.
Data Interpretation: The application displays the incoming data in a user-friendly format, allowing users to monitor and analyze the data being sent by the microcontroller.

3. Usage
3.1. Firmware Development and Testing
Efficient Programming: The application simplifies the process of uploading firmware to the ATmega328P, making it easier for developers to test and iterate on their code.
Real-time Debugging: By monitoring the data output from the microcontroller, developers can diagnose issues and verify the behavior of their code in real-time.

3.2. Microcontroller-based Projects
Flexible Configuration: The ability to adjust baud rate, parity, and other settings makes the application adaptable to various microcontroller projects that require different communication protocols.
Live Data Monitoring: The application can be used in projects where live data from sensors or other inputs connected to the microcontroller needs to be monitored and analyzed.
